## Step 4: Log in to ieng6
First, I opened my remote terminal then type the command ```ssh cs15lwi23ang@ieng.ucsd.edu``` which is my username ieng6. Since 
I have done the ssh-keygen step, signing in has been made easy, as it no longer requires the user to input their password. 
once I have type in my ieng6 ID, I pressed ```<enter>``` which prompted me that I have successfully logged in.
